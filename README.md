here is a folder of lots of code mainly written in Python and Java to improve my logical skills and competences in computer scicence.
It is about algorithms and data structures.
You can find in it several codes of plural difficulties to be really confident in this part and also to challenge myself with some "more difficult exercises".

I found all this exercises on CodeWars (EuRiAn -- actual 6 kyu Overall) and on HackerRank for ProblemSolving.
